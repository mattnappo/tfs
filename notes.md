# Some random notes

# Todo:
 * Check for filename length safety
 * Write a better `new_file` method to read from disk better
 * fs.c: `print_file`
 * Write the algorithm to find free memory
 * Write a CLI
 * Better error handling

# Other features:
 * ~~Serialization~~
 * Encryption
 * Add blocks to memory
 * Network it
 * Filepaths?

# Small things:
 * For dumping memory, add a feature to dump to a buffer
